        <h2>Biography</h2>
    
        <div>
          <p>
            Albert Szent-Györgyi was born in 1893 in Budapest, in the Kingdom of Hungary. <br>
            He began his undergraduate studies at the Institute of Anatomy at the University of Budapest, and then
            continued at the
            Institute of Physiology. <q> ...as a third year medical student, I became increasingly discontent with
              morphology which told me little about life."-he wrote in <a
                href="http://www.matud.iif.hu/2017/07/11.htm#56" target="blank">his</a> <a
                href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/101584924X128" target="blank">memoir</a>.
            </q>
          </p>
          <p>
            During the First World War, he served as an army medic, and although he was awarded the Silver Medal of
            Merit
            he
            strongly disapproved of the bloodshed. After the war, due to the complicated political situation, he
            relocated
            his research
            to Prague, later to Germany and then to the Netherlands. In the article about the <dfn
              title="the ways that cells transform nutrients into energy through a complex series of reactions">cellular
              respiration of plants</dfn> - he resolved the <a
              href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/warburg-lecture.pdf" target='_blank'>debate</a> that
            raged
            between O. Warburg and Wieland. It was then that the name Albert Szent-Györgyi became widely known in the
            academic world. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="top-aside-cont">
          <p class="p-before">
            With the help of the recognised English biochemist Sir Frederick G. Hopkins, he was able to continue his
            work
            in
            Cambridge. He isolated an organic reducing agent which he called "hexuronic acid". Cambridge awarded him
            a PhD
            for the work in 1927. <br>
            He moved to the United States to isolate more of the substance from the adrenal gland of animals. </p>
          <aside class="top-aside-elm">He invented many names for the so far unknown substance, like "ignose"
            (meaning of <i>ignosco</i>: I
            don't know) and 'godnose' (god knows). At the millennium the compound "hexuronic acid" was believed to
            be the
            same as ascorbic acid. This is no longer the case. Later Szent-Györgyi at the urging of his fellow colleague
            renamed
            it to
            ascorbic acid.</aside>
          <p class="p-after">
            In 1928 he was appointed rector of the <dfn title="From 1954 as University of Szeged">Miklós Horthy
              University</dfn>, but left for Cambridge to complete his research. In 1930 he returned to Hungary and
            took
            up the position offered at the university. He soon established a reputation for fascinating lectures and
            an
            informal leadership style. He also continued his research on ascorbic acid and isolated it from paprika
            peppers.</p>

            <p>The discovery of vitamin C has been the subject of research by scientists from all over the world.</p>

              <blockquote>
                "In the fall of 1931, an American post-doctoral fellow, Joseph Svirbely, joined Szent-Györgyi's
                research
                team. Svirbely
                had been working with C. G. King at the University of Pittsburgh, trying to isolate vitamin C. […]
                Repeated
                trials
                proved that "hexuronic acid" was, in fact, vitamin C. (Szent-Györgyi had suspected this […].) King,
                meanwhile, had also
                been close to reaching a similar conclusion. Svirbely wrote to […] King what he had found at the
                Szeged
                laboratory,
                adding that he and Szent-Györgyi were submitting a report to Nature. On April 1, 1932, Science
                published
                King's
                announcement that he had discovered vitamin C […]. King cited Szent-Györgyi's earlier work on
                hexuronic acid
                but gave
                him no credit for vitamin C. […] Szent-Györgyi and Svirbely sent off their own report to Nature,
                challenging
                King's
                priority in the discovery. "</blockquote>

          <p>The ensuing scientific debate about the priority of the discovery was resolved in 1937, when
            Szent-Györgyi
            received the Nobel Prize. Later offered the prize annuities to the victims of the Soviet-Finnish War
            (1939).
          </p>
          <p>
            In his later research he focused on the production of usable energy by the cell. He recognised that some
            organic
            acid plays a major role in biological oxidation, and came close to discovering the basic process of
            cellular
            respiration: the citrate cycle. His work was groundbreaking and helped Hans Kerbs to identify all the
            components of the cycle. The process is today also known as the <i>Krebs cycle</i> or the <i>Szent-Györgyi
              and
              Krebs cycle</i>. </p>
          <p>
            During the years of World War II, he was actively involved in the underground anti-fascist movement and
            was
            persuaded by the then Hungarian Prime Minister Miklós Kállay to travel to Istanbul and begin secret
            negotiations with the Allies. After Hungary's failure of the peaceful leaving of the Axis powers, he was
            forced to go into hiding. After the war, he undertook an active role in the political and academic life,
            among
            other things founded the Hungarian Academy of Natural Sciences. The Institute served as an intellectual
            centre
            for his fellow colleagues and apprentices and also was a home and shelter in the desperate times. The
            soon-to-come turn of political events forced him to leave his country: after his 1947 summer holiday in
            Switzerland he emigrated to the United States.</p>
          <p>
            He established the Institute for Muscle Research at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole,
            Massachusetts and started to research muscle tissues. Despite of the early financial difficulties he
            always
            managed to find supporters, even the death of his sponsor and friend left behind significant debt.</p>
          <p>
            In the 1960s he became politically more active: he wrote numerous articles and gave lectures against the
            nuclear arms race and the Vietnam War. </p>
          <p>
            After his second wife and only daughter died of breast cancer, he devoted the last two decades of
            his
            life to cancer research. Szent-Györgyi remained mentally and physically active in his last years. Only
            from
            1985, at the age of 92, did his health visibly deteriorate. In June 1986 his condition suddenly worsened
            with
            kidney and heart failure. He underwent surgery and was discharged. A few months later, on 22 October, he
            died
            of renal failure at his home.
          </p>
          <p>He is buried in Woods Hole Cemetery on the Atlantic coast. </p>
