        <h3>Biography</h3>

        <p>
          Albert Szent-Györgyi was born in 1893 in Budapest, in the Kingdom of
          Hungary. <br />
          He began his undergraduate studies at the Institute of Anatomy at the
          University of Budapest, and then continued at the Institute of
          Physiology.
          <q>
            "...as a third year medical student, I became increasingly
            discontent with morphology which told me little about life. - he
            wrote in

            >."
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>
          During the First World War, he served as an army medic, and although
          he was awarded the Silver Medal of Merit he strongly disapproved of
          the bloodshed. After the war, due to the complicated political
          situation, he relocated his research to Prague, later to Germany and
          then to the Netherlands. In the article about the
          <dfn
            title="the ways that cells transform nutrients into energy through a complex series of reactions"
            >cellular respiration of plants</dfn

          - he resolved the
          <a

          that raged between O. Warburg and Wieland. It was then that the name
          Albert Szent-Györgyi became widely known in the academic world.

            With the help of the recognised English biochemist Sir Frederick G.
            Hopkins, he was able to continue his work in Cambridge. He isolated
            an organic reducing agent which he called "hexuronic acid".
            Cambridge awarded him a PhD for the work in 1927. <br />
            He moved to the United States to isolate more of the substance from
            the adrenal gland of animals.
          </p>
          <aside class="top-aside">
            He invented many names for the so far unknown substance, like
            "ignose" (meaning of <i>ignosco</i>: I don't know) and 'godnose'
            (god knows). At the millennium the compound "hexuronic acid" was
            believed to be the same as ascorbic acid. This is no longer the
            case. Later Szent-Györgyi at the urging of his fellow colleague
            renamed it to ascorbic acid.
          </aside>
          <p class="top-aside_p-after">
            In 1928 he was appointed rector of the
            <dfn title="From 1954 as University of Szeged"
              >Miklós Horthy University</dfn
            >, but left for Cambridge to complete his research. In 1930 he
            returned to Hungary and took up the position offered at the
            university. He soon established a reputation for fascinating
            lectures and an informal leadership style. He also continued his
            research on ascorbic acid and isolated it from paprika peppers.

                "In the fall of 1931, an American post-doctoral fellow, Joseph
                Svirbely, joined Szent-Györgyi's research team. Svirbely had
                been working with C. G. King at the University of Pittsburgh,
                trying to isolate vitamin C. […] Repeated trials proved that
                "hexuronic acid" was, in fact, vitamin C. (Szent-Györgyi had
                suspected this […].) King, meanwhile, had also been close to
                reaching a similar conclusion. Svirbely wrote to […] King what
                he had found at the Szeged laboratory, adding that he and
                Szent-Györgyi were submitting a report to Nature. On April 1,
                1932, Science published King's announcement that he had
                discovered vitamin C […]. King cited Szent-Györgyi's earlier
                work on hexuronic acid but gave him no credit for vitamin C. […]
                Szent-Györgyi and Svirbely sent off their own report to Nature,
                challenging King's priority in the discovery."

            The ensuing scientific debate about the priority of the discovery
            was resolved in 1937, when Szent-Györgyi received the Nobel Prize.
            Later offered the prize annuities to the victims of the
            Soviet-Finnish War (1939).
          </p>
          <p>
            In his later research he focused on the production of usable energy
            by the cell. He recognised that some organic acid plays a major role
            in biological oxidation, and came close to discovering the basic
            process of cellular respiration: the citrate cycle. His work was
            groundbreaking and helped Hans Kerbs to identify all the components
            of the cycle. The process is today also known as the
            <i>Krebs cycle</i> or the <i>Szent-Györgyi and Krebs cycle</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the years of World War II, he was actively involved in the
            underground anti-fascist movement and was persuaded by the then
            Hungarian Prime Minister Miklós Kállay to travel to Istanbul and
            begin secret negotiations with the Allies. After Hungary's failure
            of the peaceful leaving of the Axis powers, he was forced to go into
            hiding. After the war, he undertook an active role in the political
            and academic life, among other things founded the Hungarian Academy
            of Natural Sciences. The Institute served as an intellectual centre
            for his fellow colleagues and apprentices and also was a home and
            shelter in the desperate times. The soon-to-come turn of political
            events forced him to leave his country: after his 1947 summer
            holiday in Switzerland he emigrated to the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            He established the Institute for Muscle Research at the Marine
            Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts and started to
            research muscle tissues. Despite of the early financial difficulties
            he always managed to find supporters, even the death of his sponsor
            and friend left behind significant debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1960s he became politically more active: he wrote numerous
            articles and gave lectures against the nuclear arms race and the
            Vietnam War.
          </p>
          <p>
            After his second wife and only daughter died of breast cancer, he
            devoted the last two decades of his life to cancer research.
            Szent-Györgyi remained mentally and physically active in his last
            years. Only from 1985, at the age of 92, did his health visibly
            deteriorate. In June 1986 his condition suddenly worsened with
            kidney and heart failure. He underwent surgery and was discharged. A
            few months later, on 22 October, he died of renal failure at his
            home.
          </p>
          <p>He is buried in Woods Hole Cemetery on the Atlantic coast.</p>
